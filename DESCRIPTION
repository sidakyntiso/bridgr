Description: Grading bias can arise when students are assigned different graders with varying severity levels. 
	This package implements a Bayesian version of the Aldrich and McKelvey (1977) scaling model to correct bias in grade data. 
	Our method is described in Kates, Paulsen, Tucker, and Yntiso (2022) ''Bridging the Grade Gap: Reducing Assessment Bias in a Multi-Grader Class''.
